### 📌 Background

Email marketing is one of the most powerful tools for digital platforms to stay connected with their audience, promote new offerings, and drive engagement. Especially for subscription-based content platforms, emails play a key role in announcing new features, encouraging participation in events, and converting readers into paying customers.

This project centers around a niche content platform that caters to a global community of DIY creators and readers. The platform regularly sends out email campaigns to inform users about product updates, online events, and subscription offers. These campaigns are crucial for building relationships with users and generating revenue.

To stay competitive and understand what works, the marketing team wants to track how these campaigns are performing across different audiences, regions, and device types. This involves looking into metrics like open rate, click rate, bounce rate, and conversion rate to make data-driven improvements.
